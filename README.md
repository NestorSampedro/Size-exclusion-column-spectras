# Size-exclusion-column-spectras
I've created some python scripts that can read, parse and plot data from size exclusion chromatography

These scripts work for sepharose columns S6 10/300 (24 mL) and s6 5/150 (3 mL)

The user needs to change the file name to execute the scripts onto and the plot features
